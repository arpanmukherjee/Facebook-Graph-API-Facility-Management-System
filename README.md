## Project Details
This is an automated facility management system where task will be automatically assigned to the workers. This portal provides various services to the resident of IIITD like Electrical, Housekeeping, Horticulture, and work done by carpenter and mason, and others. Main functionality of this portal is to provide a platform for booking complaint for repair, performing maintenance or upgradation activities, keeping track record of each employee.

### Introduction
User using the system are Students, FMS Employee and FMS Administrator. There are employee for each type of service like electrician to do electrical work, sweepers for housekeeping, gardeners, carpenter and mason. This will be a text based system. All complaints and facility management will be done through command.

We made a Facebook based system. For this we have created a FMS Facebook page. On that page users can communicate using Facebook post where they will type the command in specific format and further communication (like request for feedback, etc.) regarding that complaint/information will be posted in the reply of that post/message.
